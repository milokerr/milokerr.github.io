<h1>The Portfolio of Milo Kerr</h1><br>
I'm from Dallas Texas, but I'm a student at the University of Michigan.<br>
I'm a senior and I'm majoring in Computer Science under the college of Literature, Science, and Arts (LSA).

	For this project, I was responsible for player movement/controls, many of the enemies, the weapons (including our custom one, the sniper), and the audio.<br>
	I also made some of the custom sprites used in our game by using a pixel art editor.</li><br>
<li><a href="https://milokerr.itch.io/encore">ENCORE</a><br>
	This game is best described as a mashup between Vampire Survivors and a rhythm game.<br>
	It's much shorter and smaller in scope however, as it was a solo project developed in about two weeks.<br>
	The only asset I got online is the font used. Everything else is made entirely from scratch.<br>
	Some sites I used:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Pixilart: Used to create the pixel art.
		</li>
		<li>
			Bandlab: Used to create the music.
		</li>
	</ul>
	Some games that influenced my game:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Vampire Survivors: For the general idea and set up.
		</li>
		<li>
			Friday Night Funkin': For the PC rhythm game mechanics.
		</li>
		<li>
			Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean: For the inspiration to combine weapons with instruments.
		</li>
		<li>
			UBERMOSH:OMEGA: For the more bullet-hell vibe as well as the shorter runs that emphasize getting a good score.
		</li>
	</ul>

This is a split-screen coop puzzle platformer. It revolves around trading and combining colors with your partner and various objects to complete levels.
This game was my final project for EECS 494 at UofM. Worked on it with 3 others for six weeks.
Everyone worked on quite a bit of everything, but most notably I made the 4th and 7th levels and did all of the UI and story.
